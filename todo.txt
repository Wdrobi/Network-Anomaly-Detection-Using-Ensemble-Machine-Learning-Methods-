However, here are some valuable enhancements you could add for a stronger project:

Feature Importance Analysis - Identify which features contribute most to anomaly detection
Cross-Validation - K-fold CV for more robust evaluation
Anomaly Score Visualizations - Show score distributions by model
Threshold Optimization - Find optimal decision thresholds per model
Prediction API - Flask/FastAPI endpoint to detect anomalies on new data
Model Interpretability - SHAP values to explain individual predictions
Performance Benchmarking - Timing analysis and computational resource comparison
